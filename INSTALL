Prerequisite:
    The Elastic Linear Algebra Interface (ELAI) require Python, SWIG 3.x,
    MPI, Mpi4Py and NumPy.
    We have already tested by Python-2.7.5 and SWIG-3.0.7. We recomended to
    use the Python-2.7 or later.

Build:
    To build and install the ELAI, simply type the following:

    Ex.
        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ make install

    By default the ELAI installs itself in /usr/local. If you need to install
    the ELAI in a different location or in you home directory, use the
    --prefix option to ./configure.

    Ex.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/home/youname/projects
        $ make
        $ make install

    Type `./configure --help' for more information.

Use GNU C compiler:
    ELAI is recomend to use Intel Compiler for parformance improvement.
    When you use GNU C compiler, you will need to pass --with-gcc flag
    to ./configure.

    Ex.
        $ ./configure --with-gcc

Options for related software:
    When you installed to not default directory /usr, use below options to
    pass ./configure.

        --with-elai=PATH
        --with-mpi=PATH
        --with-mpi4py=PATH
        --with-numpy=PATH

Debugging:
    Please set the environment variable of OPTIMIZE_FLAGS to `-g -O0', when
    you debugging the AISTMeshLib. And execute the make command.

    Ex.

        $ export OPTIMIZE_FLAGS
	$ OPTIMIZE_FLAGS="-g -O0"
	$ make

Disable assertion:
    Please pass --without-assertion flag to ./configure when you need to
    disabled assertion, then -UNDEBUG is not passed to C and C++ compilers.

    Ex.
        $ ./configure --without-asserion
