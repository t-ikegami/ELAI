0. ABOUT

This library provides sparse linear solvers (LU factoring and preconditioned iterative solvers).
We have designed ELAI to fit linear problems on Technology CAD (especially Device Modeling).
Orderings, partitionings and solvings are constrained by physical information of the problem,
and we could build more robust and complicated algorithms easily.
All codes are implemented in C++ template classes, so that you could apply all solvers to any-precision problems.

ELAI functionalities..
  merging matrices decomposed via domains.
  LU factoring with distributed matrix.
  additive schwarz preconditioner for decomposed matrices.
  structural ordering on coupled systems.
  unsymmetric permutations for maximize the product on diagonals.
  column-wise scalings.
  and so on..

1. PREPARATION
Before you use ELAI, you have to install following libraries.

  MPI             -- All test are verified via OpenMPI 1.6.5
  BLAS and LAPACK -- The optimised library is preferable. (Alt. Intel MKL)
  ScaLAPACK 2.0.2 -- The optimized library is preferable. (Alt. Intel MKL)
  METIS 5.1.0     -- http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview
                     Recommended the following configuration.
                       #define IDXTYPEWIDTH 32
  MUMPS 5.0.1     -- http://mumps.enseeiht.fr
                     You have no needs to install PT-Scotch or ParMETIS.

3. TEST
You could check behaviors of this library by following.

  $ cd Test
  $ PREFIX=<INSTALLATION_PATH> ./Run

You might need to change compile options, the include-path (-I) and the library-path (-L).
